## 📡 Tech Stack:

- [React.js](https://react.dev/) The library for web and native user interfaces. React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/) In traditional websites, the browser requests a document from a web server, downloads and evaluates CSS and JavaScript assets, and renders the HTML sent from the server. When the user clicks a link, it starts the process all over again for a new page.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.

- [TanStack Query v3](https://tanstack.com/) High-quality open-source software for web developers.
Headless, type-safe, & powerful utilities for Web Applications, Routing, State Management, Data Visualization, Datagrids/Tables, and more.

- [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) Build your component library. Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

- [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) An open source component library optimized for fast development, easy maintenance, and accessibility. Just import and go—no configuration required.

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

- [React Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify/) React-Toastify allows you to add notifications to your app with ease. No more nonsense!

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

- [Prettier](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Prettier is a code formatter that enforces consistent style across your codebase, automatically formatting your code to improve readability and maintainability.
